# FaceTrack Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2.0

## Document Control
- **Owner:** Product Team, FaceTrack
- **Last Updated:** 2024-04-18
- **Status:** Final – Approved for implementation
- **Distribution:** Engineering, Design, QA, Security, Customer Success

## 1. Executive Summary
FaceTrack v2.0 enhances our facial recognition-based attendance and access management platform with real-time monitoring, improved accuracy, and enterprise-grade admin tooling. The release focuses on resolving performance gaps identified in the v1.5 release, enabling scalable deployments across multi-site organizations, and reducing false positives/negatives that have limited adoption in regulated industries.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics
### 2.1 Objectives
1. Deliver sub-second recognition latency for up to 20 concurrent camera streams.
2. Improve verification accuracy to 99.5% true-positive and <0.1% false-positive rates.
3. Provide compliance-ready audit trails and access logs with export capabilities.
4. Enable self-service enrollment and roster management for enterprise administrators.

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- ≥95% of beta customers report confidence in accuracy improvements.
- System handles 50,000 identity records with <5% performance degradation.
- Audit report export usage ≥ 60% among enterprise administrators during beta.
- Support tickets related to enrollment errors reduced by 40% compared to v1.5.

## 3. Product Scope
### 3.1 In Scope
- Real-time recognition pipeline optimized for GPU acceleration.
- Adaptive learning loop that re-trains models using admin-approved feedback.
- Centralized admin console with role-based access controls (RBAC).
- REST APIs for roster management, access control systems, and HRIS integrations.
- Audit logs with configurable retention (30/90/365 days) and export to CSV/JSON.
- Mobile companion app updates for enrollment confirmation and manual overrides.

### 3.2 Out of Scope
- New hardware device development.
- On-prem appliance packaging (deferred to v2.1).
- Voice recognition or multi-factor biometrics.

## 4. User Personas & Needs
- **Security Administrator (Primary):** Needs to manage access policies, monitor alerts, and generate compliance reports across sites.
- **Site Supervisor:** Requires quick access to live attendance dashboards and the ability to resolve recognition disputes.
- **IT Integrator:** Needs reliable APIs and documentation to connect FaceTrack with existing enterprise systems.
- **Employee/User:** Wants seamless entry with minimal false rejections and an option to review and update their profile data.

## 5. User Stories
1. As a Security Administrator, I can create and assign roles with granular permissions so that sensitive features are restricted to authorized staff.
2. As a Security Administrator, I can review recognition events in real time and flag incorrect matches for retraining.
3. As a Site Supervisor, I can view live attendance dashboards filtered by location and shift.
4. As an IT Integrator, I can sync employee data from our HRIS nightly and receive webhook notifications for access events.
5. As an Employee, I can self-enroll using the mobile app and receive confirmation once my profile is approved.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Real-Time Recognition Engine
- Process up to 20 HD streams simultaneously with <800 ms average recognition latency.
- Support configurable thresholds per site for match confidence and escalation workflows.
- Provide status health checks with per-stream diagnostics via API.

### 6.2 Adaptive Learning & Feedback
- Allow administrators to flag false positives/negatives and trigger retraining queues.
- Implement approval workflow so only verified feedback affects production models.
- Deliver weekly retraining summaries with accuracy metrics.

### 6.3 Admin Console
- RBAC: Support predefined roles (Owner, Admin, Supervisor, Viewer) and custom roles with CRUD operations.
- Dashboard: Live event feed, attendance summaries, and system health indicators.
- Enrollment: Batch import via CSV/HRIS sync, manual entry, and mobile app confirmations.
- Reporting: Export audit logs and access events to CSV and JSON with filter options.

### 6.4 Integrations
- HRIS Sync: REST connector with configurable field mapping, deduplication, and error handling.
- Access Control: Webhooks to third-party systems with retry/backoff.
- Analytics: Optional export to SIEM tools via secure SFTP drops.

### 6.5 Mobile App Enhancements
- Push notifications for enrollment approval/denial.
- Manual override workflow requiring supervisor authentication.
- Offline mode capturing events and syncing once connectivity is restored.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Maintain ≥99.9% uptime SLA with automated failover.
- **Security:** SOC 2 Type II controls, data encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), MFA for admin roles.
- **Privacy:** Support data subject access requests (DSAR) and configurable retention policies.
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling across regions with auto-provisioning on Kubernetes.
- **Compliance:** Provide audit-ready reports for ISO 27001 and GDPR.

## 8. Data & Analytics
- Event schema defined with unique IDs, timestamps, location, confidence score, and actor metadata.
- Store raw images for 30 days by default, with admin-configurable retention.
- Expose analytics dashboards for false positive/negative rates, enrollment status, and event frequency.

## 9. Deployment & Rollout Plan
1. **Alpha (Week 0-4):** Internal validation with synthetic datasets; verify latency benchmarks.
2. **Beta (Week 5-10):** Limited release to 3 enterprise customers with weekly feedback sessions.
3. **General Availability (Week 11+):** Global rollout with migration playbook and customer success training.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
- **Model Bias:** Continuous bias testing across demographics; partner with legal/compliance for oversight.
- **Infrastructure Cost:** Monitor GPU utilization and implement auto-scaling policies to manage costs.
- **Integration Complexity:** Provide reference SDKs and sandbox environment to reduce onboarding time.
- **User Adoption:** Offer in-product guidance and Customer Success webinars for administrators.

## 11. Open Questions
- Finalize data retention defaults for regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare).
- Determine pricing model for advanced analytics add-on.
- Confirm legal review of mobile manual override workflow.

## 12. Appendices
- **Glossary:** Definitions for enrollment, recognition event, confidence score, RBAC roles.
- **Dependencies:** Computer vision team deliverables (model retraining pipeline), infra automation backlog, mobile team for app updates.
- **Change Log:** v2.0 incorporates latency improvements, adaptive learning, RBAC expansion, and compliance reporting enhancements compared to v1.5.
